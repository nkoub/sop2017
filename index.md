## Control of Self-Organized Patterns on Complex Networks

### Description
Patterns are widespread in nature: regular forms and geometries, like spirals, trees, and stripes, recur in different contexts, from ecology to neuroscience just to cite a few. The mathematics that underlies patterns formation focuses on the dynamical interplay between reaction and diffusion processes. Usually, reaction-diffusion models are defined on a regular lattice, either continuous or discrete. In many cases of interest, it is however more natural to schematize the system as a network bearing a complex structure. Sycnhronization, chimera states, localized stationary and oscillatory patterns are all examples of self-organized patterns that reflect the peculiar interplay between network architecture and inherent nonlinear dynamics. Aim of this Special Session is to gather together experts working on the control of self-organized patterns on complex networks. Traveling waves and stationary patterns can be in principle turned one into the other, or eventually silenced, by acting on the specific feature of the network and its associated spectrum. Existing fixed points of a multispecies population model can be changed as sought, by the supervised inclusion of control species that displays specific reaction patterns. Stability and resilience can be also enforced into the scrutinized system via dedicated control strategies. Experimental and theoretical works facing these challenges will be reviewed and discussed within this Session.
